# STEP 2

First, make a free account on GitHub:

Log in to GitHub and then you can skip this section and move to the next one (Creating a New Repository).
After creating an account, you should see a page like this:

Now enter your username, email, and password in the boxes shown on the right side of the screen and then click the green Sign up for GitHub button.

Tip: 1. The username you entered will later be a part of the URL of the website you'll publish later.
     2.  If there is no problem with the username or password, the following screen will be displayed.
