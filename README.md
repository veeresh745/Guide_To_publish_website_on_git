# How to Publish Webpages with GitHub

While developing a website I have a thought in my mind that how can i publish it freely in the internet because it is not soo.. cheap to publish a website in the internet
So Here is the full guide---

I have Devided The guide In few steps So, It would be Easy for anyone to follow these steps

# Before You Begin

What You Need to Know
Basic knowledge of HTML & CSS.
Completing the HTML & CSS Study I lesson on Progate is enough for this article.

Note:
1. Although we'll be using GitHub, previous knowledge of git is not required.
2. All the screenshots used in this article were taken on Windows, but this tutorial will also work on Mac as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Step 1

Before we start working on it, let's take a look at the steps to publish a webpage on GitHub.
First, let's create the webpage we want to publish.
Here is The learning path so that you can learn some basics of html an css:-
# HTML- https://htmldog.com/guides/html/
# css - https://htmldog.com/guides/css/
These sources are suggested by Mr.David J. Malan In cs50 classes.

Once you setup the webpage, upload the HTML and/or CSS files and images to GitHub. If you haven't made a GitHub account yet, you will need to make one first.
Finally, by simply adjusting some file settings on GitHub, you'll be able to publish the webpage for free!
It may sound difficult to publish your own webpage online, but don't worry, we'll show you a simple, step-by-step method.
Let's get started!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 2

First, make a free account on GitHub:

https://github.com/
If you already have a GitHub account
Log in to GitHub and then you can skip this section and move to the next one (Creating a New Repository).
After creating an account, you should see a page like this:

<img width="1094" alt="making account" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113976563-ee762500-985e-11eb-967c-61a5ac22e5fb.png">

Now enter your username, email, and password in the boxes shown on the right side of the screen and then click the green Sign up for GitHub button.

Tip: 1. The username you entered will later be a part of the URL of the website you'll publish later.
     2.  If there is no problem with the username or password, the following screen will be displayed.
![selecting plan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113976766-2bdab280-985f-11eb-912d-71dddb365708.png)

The free plan is enough for this tutorial. Click the green button Continue once you make sure you checked Free plan like the image.
After this you will see a page for the survey, but you can just click the green button at the very bottom without answering it.
You should see a page like the image below. If you do, you've successfully created your GitHub account. Well done.
![did it](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113977399-2893f680-9860-11eb-8649-589c32463189.png)

If you see this page, you did it!

Check the email you used for this GitHub account to verify your registration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 3
#Creating a New Repository

Next, we'll create a "repository". A repository is like a project folder that helps you manage one webpage or application on GitHub.
Like the image below, click the + (plus sign) icon on the upper-right and select New Repository.

<img width="1021" alt="repo creation" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113978436-92f96680-9861-11eb-9d2f-a473f236140f.png">

Give the repository a name by entering it in the form labeled Repository name in the middle of the page. The repository name can be anything, but the URL of the webpage will depend on this repository name (*see the explanation below).

If your account name is set to username.github.io:**

The URL for your page will be: https://username.github.io
Otherwise,

The URL for your page will be: https://username.github.io/repositoryname

So, if your username is veeresh745,

and your repository name is veeresh745.github.io then the URL will be veeresh745.github.io.
If your repository name is first_web then the URL would be veeresh745.github.io/first_web.

If there's no problem, then let's create a repository with username.github.io (*you can always change the repository name later).

<img width="960" alt="repo creation2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113979235-9b9e6c80-9862-11eb-8f56-b9a6c58b101e.png">

Note:- 1.You Can Add Readme.md Files
       2. And A licence you want 
       3. For More Info On licence Wisit this site- https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository
Once you've entered the repository name, click the green Create repository button.

You've successfully created a repository. On the screen shown, click the link README like the image below:

<img width="946" alt="Readme" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113979769-50d12480-9863-11eb-9cd5-f3e01c8bbde2.png">

This "README.md" is a file you use to write a description of the repository.
You don't need to write anything there for now. To save the added file, click the green Commit new file button at the very bottom of the page.

Now let's start learning how to upload HTML and CSS files in the next section!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 4

Now I am assuming that you have created your webpage And It is Ready to publish On github

And These Files are look like this:-

# <img width="957" alt="sample" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113982315-3f3d4c00-9866-11eb-90c7-25a0fc30950f.png">

# Upload HTML/CSS Files

First, let's upload an HTML file called index.html.

Click the Create new file button, as shown in the image below:
<img width="960" alt="create file" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113983089-297c5680-9867-11eb-8f80-0f65f706f2de.png">

VERY IMP- 1. Your homepage Name should be index.html
          2. you should not miss any file while uploadiing
          3. just drag and drop all the files and it's done.


<img width="959" alt="finalising" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113984442-ba9ffd00-9868-11eb-9642-047505972ec6.png">

# Now Click ''COMMIT CHANGES'' Then you will see this:- 

<img width="958" alt="commit changes" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113984675-f935b780-9868-11eb-95ef-348bc47f0354.png">

You can check the content of each file by clicking the file name to make sure that everything has been uploaded correctly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 5

# Publishing your Webpage

Let's publish a webpage with the files you uploaded.

First, click the Settings tab on top right of the screen.

<img width="957" alt="setting" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113985156-7c570d80-9869-11eb-911f-500edd8bfa75.png">

You'll find GitHub Pages if you keep scrolling down the page.<img width="957" alt="setting" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113985600-f7b8bf00-9869-11eb-9628-892b4f4b8cca.png">

If it says "Your site is published at ..." where the green background is, the webpage is already published with the URL shown here.

If not, Source is probably set as None, so change it to the default branch (master or main depending on when the repository was created) and then click the button Save to display the URL.

This is the end of the procedure to publish your webpage to the internet. Now anybody can access the webpage you made with the URL!

*If nothing is shown when accessing the URL, there is a possibility that the display page is being processed. It may take a while, so try coming back and loading the page later.

# NOW YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PUBLISHED THE WEB PAGE ON GIT HUB AND YOU HAVE THE LINK TO VISIT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 6

# Updating Published Pages

Lastly, let's learn how to update the webpage you published. This GitHub Pages updates not only the code in the file, but it automatically updates the published webpage as well (it may take a few minutes for the changes to take effect).

This time you'll update index.html for practice.

Click the tab Code on the top left of the screen and then click index.html inside of the page shown.

# You'll be able to check the contents of the file. On the same screen, click the pencil icon shown on the top right.


<img width="960" alt="very final" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113986353-cc829f80-986a-11eb-92b9-b2b91ae19792.png">

On the screen shown, you can edit the code of index.html.

Once you're done editing, save the changes by clicking the green button at the very end Commit changes.

You can also delete the file by clicking the trash can icon that is next to the pencil icon.

This is the end of the tutorial about publishing a webpage by using GitHub.
