# Step 1

Before we start working on it, let's take a look at the steps to publish a webpage on GitHub.
First, let's create the webpage we want to publish.
Here is The learning path so that you can learn some basics of html an css:-
# HTML- https://htmldog.com/guides/html/
# css - https://htmldog.com/guides/css/
These sources are suggested by Mr.David J. Malan In cs50 classes.

Once you setup the webpage, upload the HTML and/or CSS files and images to GitHub. If you haven't made a GitHub account yet, you will need to make one first.
Finally, by simply adjusting some file settings on GitHub, you'll be able to publish the webpage for free!
It may sound difficult to publish your own webpage online, but don't worry, we'll show you a simple, step-by-step method.
Let's get started!

# STEP 2

First, make a free account on GitHub:

https://github.com/
If you already have a GitHub account
Log in to GitHub and then you can skip this section and move to the next one (Creating a New Repository).
After creating an account, you should see a page like this:

Now enter your username, email, and password in the boxes shown on the right side of the screen and then click the green Sign up for GitHub button.

Tip: 1. The username you entered will later be a part of the URL of the website you'll publish later.
     2.  If there is no problem with the username or password, the following screen will be displayed.

The free plan is enough for this tutorial. Click the green button Continue once you make sure you checked Free plan like the image.
After this you will see a page for the survey, but you can just click the green button at the very bottom without answering it.
You should see a page like the image below. If you do, you've successfully created your GitHub account. Well done.
![did it](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113977399-2893f680-9860-11eb-8649-589c32463189.png)

If you see this page, you did it!

Check the email you used for this GitHub account to verify your registration.

# STEP 3
#Creating a New Repository

Next, we'll create a "repository". A repository is like a project folder that helps you manage one webpage or application on GitHub.
Like the image below, click the + (plus sign) icon on the upper-right and select New Repository.

<img width="1021" alt="repo creation" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431920/113978436-92f96680-9861-11eb-9d2f-a473f236140f.png">

Give the repository a name by entering it in the form labeled Repository name in the middle of the page. The repository name can be anything, but the URL of the webpage will depend on this repository name (*see the explanation below).

If your account name is set to username.github.io:**

The URL for your page will be: https://username.github.io
Otherwise,

The URL for your page will be: https://username.github.io/repositoryname
